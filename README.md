# Team Generator

---

Do you need to divide people into teams, but don't want to randomize teams with numbers or a count off? Add the names to the Team generator and let the computer do all of the work!!!

This project is written with HTML, vanilla JS, and CSS. This web app is responsive and fits small smart phones up to lg screens. As I did not use bootstrap, you will find individual media queries.
